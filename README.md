# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Web App

An interactive **AI-powered web application** built with **Streamlit** and **PyTorch** that detects the presence of brain tumors from MRI scan images.  
The model is based on **ResNet18** and fine-tuned on 1,356 labeled brain scan images.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload a **single MRI image** or **multiple images** for batch prediction  
- 🎯 Displays **probability scores** and **model confidence**  
- 📊 Visualizes classification threshold and output probabilities  
- 🧩 Provides model performance metrics (F1-score, ROC AUC, sensitivity, specificity)  
- 💻 Interactive, no coding required — just upload an image!  
- ⚠️ Includes disclaimer for non-clinical use
